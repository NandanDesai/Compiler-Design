# Compiler-Design

(THIS PROJECT IS STILL IN THE EARLY STAGE OF DEVELOPMENT)
This is a project to practically demonstrate how the compilers are designed, 
how the high-level language is compiled and assembled into an object program with the help of compilers and assemblers.
The high-level language here is a very striped down version of C and is compiled down to SIC (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplified_Instructional_Computer) assembly language.
Further, this SIC assembly language is fed to an SIC assembler which then produces an object program.
